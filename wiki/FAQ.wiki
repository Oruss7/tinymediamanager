== How does tinyMediaManager find my movies ==
tinyMediaManager is constructed to search for movies in separate directories. One movie per directory! It scans the chosen directories recursively until it finds a moviefile in a directory (recognized filetypes are specified in config.xml). The directory name will be taken as the temporary movie name.

== tinyMediaManager crashes at startup or the information is wrong ==
Try to initialize the data tinyMediaManager uses:
First delete tmm.odb (database where all data is stored). If that didn't work also try to delete config.xml

== tinyMediaManager crashes as soon as I click on a moviename ==
If you are using Java 7 with a release lower than u10, then tinyMediaManager will crash because of a bug in java. Its fixed in Java 7u10.
Just wait until that patch is available or switch to Java6
